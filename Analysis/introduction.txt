	When an educational program is run, there are (at least) three key metrics to track success: attendance, engagement, and completion. In many cases, these metrics are linked: lower attendance tends to predict lower achievement and lower graduation rates. However, this relationship is not always the case.

	Take, for instance, the Catholic Confirmation program at St. Elizabeth Seton Parish in Bedford, New Hampshire. From 2013 to 2016, a total of {n} students high school sophomores attended the confirmation program. The purpose of this program is to educate students about their Catholic faith and prepare them for the sacrament of Confirmation. In this program, “graduation” is choosing to join the Catholic Church by receiving the sacrament of Confirmation. To prepare, these students are required to attend classes and are pushed to engage the community by volunteering at least five times for the parish. These three metrics (confirmation, attendance, and graduation) are analyzed in this paper.
